For now I have set up a restaurant/pub style management kind of game with some simple 3D props and C# mechanics which I am currently working on.
Point and click with a UI interface, and each item should do an action when clicked or give a text hint about some "info" they hold.

The main room (tables and client zone) has most of the programming part for now, as I'm trying to set the initial components of:
* The client-tables and menu interactions (order receipts and food item selection).
* The kitchen times (food preparation) and the storeroom stock with its necessary ingredients.

I have also set up the initial scripting components for toilet-doors and visual information.

<br>

Update 11-Sept-2023
+ Made significant changes on props (new prefabs, objects moved around and a lot of code <del>pain</del> fixing).
+ Established a new Rendering Pipeline (URP) and upgraded the Unity Engine to version 2022-03.
+ Starting to have a mental feel for the game setting: medieval-ish tabern managment kind? Previously it was a modern setting.
