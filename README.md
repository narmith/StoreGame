# StoreGame
A work in progress 3D Store management game, using Unity.

For now I have set up a restaurant style management kind of game with some simple 3D props and C# mechanics which I am currently working on.
We can move around and interact with diferent items via the mouse and keyboard, nothing fancy.
Each item should do an action when clicked or give a text hint about some "info" they hold.

The Saloon room (main room with tables and clients) has most of the programming part for now, as I'm trying to set the initial components of:
1) the client-tables and menu interactions (order receipts and food item selection).
2) the kitchen times (food preparation) and the storeroom stock with the ingredients.
